Keep raw poultry away from ready-to-eat foods such as salad, fruit and bread. Make sure that the chicken is cooked until steaming hot all the way through, that no pink meat is left and that any juices run clear. Any leftovers should be cooled within 1-2 hours and placed in the fridge (for up to 2 days) or frozen.
